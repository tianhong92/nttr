# nttr
Welcome to [nttr](/), the world's greatest vowelless microblogging service! nttr is in seriousness a learning exercise for both the Ruby programming language and Ruby on Rails framework.

### Holy Crap, Features
At this moment in time, nttr supports:

* User registration.
* User authentication and sessions.
* Tweet creation and destruction.
* Dynamic dingdong wotsit avatars generated by the fantastic [Aodrable Avatars](http://avatars.adorable.io/) service.

### Ruby
nttr supports Ruby `2.2.3` and Ruby on Rails `4.2.4`.

### Ware Ye, Traveller
nttr is a *learning exercise*. Do **not** use this in any sort of production environment. Don't even use this for testing, unless you want to test the volume and frequency of your chortles as you gaze upon my hamfisted code. This is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad web application.
